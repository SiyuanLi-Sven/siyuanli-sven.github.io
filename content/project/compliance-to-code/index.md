## Overview

The **Compliance-to-Code** dataset is constructed from 361 authoritative Chinese financial regulations, primarily from the Beijing Stock Exchange (BSE), covering ten core thematic areas. It includes 1,159 annotated Compliance Units (CUs) and 307 executable compliance automation tasks in Python.

## Key Components

1. **Dataset:** The first large-scale Chinese financial regulation dataset tailored for code-based compliance reasoning.
2. **FinCheck Pipeline:** An end-to-end pipeline that leverages the Compliance-to-Code dataset for automated compliance checking.
3. **Compliance Unit Graph:** A structured representation of financial regulations and their relationships.
