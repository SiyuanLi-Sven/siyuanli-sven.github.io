abstract: '"Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis task.'
summary: An LLM-based uncertainty-aware framework for interpreting Federal Reserve communications with enhanced reliability.

## Overview

This paper introduces an innovative **uncertainty-aware framework** for interpreting Federal Reserve communications ("Fedspeak"), combining large language models with monetary policy domain expertise to achieve more reliable and transparent policy stance classification.

## Key Contributions

1. **Domain-Specific Reasoning Integration**: Incorporates monetary policy transmission mechanism knowledge to enrich semantic understanding of Federal Reserve communications, emulating how human experts analyze policy stances.

2. **Dynamic Uncertainty Decoding Module**: Introduces a novel uncertainty quantification approach that:
   - Decomposes perceptual uncertainty into cognitive risk and environmental ambiguity
   - Adaptively selects decoding strategies based on model confidence
   - Provides reliability indicators for predictions

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework**: Establishes rigorous evaluation metrics combining:
   - Traditional performance measures (Macro-F1, Weighted-F1)
   - Uncertainty calibration assessment
   - Statistical validation of uncertainty-error correlations

## Technical Innovations

### Monetary Policy Transmission Path Modeling
- **Financial Entity Relations**: Decomposes Fedspeak into atomic relations (CAUSE, COND, EVID, PURP, ACT, COMP)
- **Transmission Channels**: Models policy signals through credit, asset price, and aggregate demand channels
- **Structured Templates**: Uses economic reasoning templates to generate policy advice and explanations

### Uncertainty-Aware Prediction
- **Perceptual Uncertainty (PU)**: PU = EA Ã— CR, where EA is environmental ambiguity and CR is cognitive risk
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Aggressive decoding for low uncertainty, conservative sampling for high uncertainty
- **Reliability Signals**: Provides confidence indicators to guide human-AI collaboration

## Experimental Results

- **State-of-the-art Performance**: Achieves 0.7327 Macro-F1 and 0.7426 Weighted-F1 on FOMC dataset
- **Uncertainty Validation**: Statistical analysis confirms significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates (p < 0.001)
- **Ablation Studies**: Transmission path reasoning contributes most significantly to performance improvements

## Practical Implications

The framework enables:
- **Enhanced Financial Forecasting**: More reliable interpretation of Fed communications for market analysis
- **Risk-Aware Trading**: Uncertainty signals help identify when to seek human expert consultation
- **Transparent AI**: Provides interpretable reasoning paths grounded in economic theory

*This work bridges the gap between economic domain expertise and modern NLP techniques, offering a principled approach to financial text analysis with quantified confidence measures.*
