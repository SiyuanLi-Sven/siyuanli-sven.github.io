abstract: We propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Federal Reserve communications and classifying monetary policy stance. The framework incorporates domain-specific reasoning grounded in monetary policy transmission mechanisms and introduces dynamic uncertainty decoding to enhance classification accuracy and model reliability.

## Overview

This paper introduces an **uncertainty-aware framework** for interpreting Federal Reserve communications, combining LLMs with monetary policy domain expertise.

## Key Contributions

1. **Domain-Specific Reasoning**: Incorporates monetary policy transmission mechanism knowledge
2. **Dynamic Uncertainty Decoding**: Novel uncertainty quantification approach
3. **State-of-the-art Performance**: Achieves superior results on policy stance analysis
